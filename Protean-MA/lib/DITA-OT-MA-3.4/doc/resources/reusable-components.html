      <p class="p">The Saxon project has announced plans to remove XSLT 1.0 support from the Saxon-HE library that ships with
        DITA-OT:</p>
      <blockquote class="lq">…we’re dropping XSLT 1.0
        backwards compatibility mode from Saxon-HE, and hope to eliminate it entirely in due course.<br><div style="text-align:right"><a href="https://www.xml.com/news/release-saxon-98/"><cite>https://www.xml.com/news/release-saxon-98/</cite></a></div></blockquote>
      <p class="p">DITA-OT 3.0 and 3.0.1 included Saxon-HE 9.8.0.5, which rejects XSLT stylesheets that specify
          <code class="ph codeph">version="1.0"</code>. Plug-ins with XSLT templates specifying version 1.0 will fail with the message
          “<samp class="ph msgph">XSLT 1.0 compatibility mode is not available in this configuration</samp>.”</p>
      <p class="p">To resolve this issue, change any occurrences of <code class="ph codeph">&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"&gt;</code> in custom
        plug-in stylesheets to at least <code class="ph codeph">&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="2.0"&gt;</code>.</p>
      <div class="note tip note_tip"><span class="note__title">Tip:</span> DITA-OT 3.0.2 includes Saxon-HE 9.8.0.7, which restores XSLT 1.0 backwards-compatibility mode,
        but the DITA Open Toolkit project recommends upgrading all stylesheets to XSLT 2.0 to ensure plug-ins remain
        compatible with future versions of DITA-OT and Saxon-HE.</div>

      <p class="p">Authored by Leigh W. White, DITA Specialist at IXIASOFT, and published by XML Press, <cite class="cite">DITA for
          Print</cite> walks readers through developing a PDF customization from scratch. </p>
      <p class="p">Here is an excerpt from the back cover:</p>
      <blockquote class="lq"><cite class="cite">DITA for Print</cite> is for anyone who wants to learn how to create PDFs using the DITA Open Toolkit
        without learning everything there is to know about XSL-FO, XSLT, or XPath, or even about the DITA Open Toolkit
        itself. <cite class="cite">DITA for Print</cite> is written for non-programmers, by a non-programmer, and although it is
        written for people who have a good understanding of the DITA standard, you don’t need a technical background to
        get custom PDFs up and running quickly.</blockquote>
      <p class="p">This is an excellent, long-needed resource that was initially developed in 2013 for DITA-OT 1.8.</p>
      <p class="p">The second edition has been revised to cover DITA Open Toolkit Version 2, including customizing the DITA 1.3
        troubleshooting topic type, localization strings, bookmarks, and the new back-cover functionality.</p>
      <div class="note important note_important"><span class="note__title">Important:</span> 
        <p class="p">The first edition of <cite class="cite">DITA for Print</cite> recommended copying entire files from the PDF2 plug-in to
          your custom plug-in. The DITA-OT project — and the second edition of the book — do not recommend this
          practice.</p>
        <p class="p">Instead, you should copy only the specific attribute sets and templates that you want to override. Following
          this practice will more cleanly isolate your customizations from the DITA-OT code, which will make it easier
          for you to update your plug-ins to work with future versions of DITA-OT.</p></div>

      <p class="p">Authored by Eliot Kimber and published by XML Press, this seminal resource contains a chapter dedicated to DITA
        Open Toolkit: “Running, Configuring, and Customizing the Open Toolkit”. In addition to a robust overview of
        DITA-OT customization and extension, the chapter contains a detailed example of customizing a PDF plug-in to
        specify 7" × 10" paper size and custom fonts for body text and headers.</p>
      <p class="p">The DITA-OT chapter in <cite class="cite">DITA for Practitioners: Volume 1</cite> was written for DITA-OT 1.5.4, which was
        the latest stable version at the time it was written.</p>
