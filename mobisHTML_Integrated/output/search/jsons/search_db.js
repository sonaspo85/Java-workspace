Driving Obey all traffic laws while driving. • Relying solely on the navigation system may cause violation of traffic rules and regulations, resulting in an accident. In order to check the vehicle speed, look at the speedometer first, not the speed on the navigation system. • The speed on the navigation system may differ from actual vehicle speed. While driving, refrain from staring at the screen. • An accident may occur by negligence in keeping your eyes forward. • To use the screen or buttons requiring multiple steps, first stop your vehicle. To use your mobile phone, first stop your vehicle. • When you use your mobile phone while driving, it may disperse your attention, resulting in an accident. • When making a call while driving, use the Bluetooth Hands-free function and if possible, minimise the call time. Make sure the volume on your phone is sufficiently low so that external sounds are audible. • When you drive with no external sound present may cause a traffic accident. • If you drive for a long time with a loud audio volume, it may affect your hearing. For emergency services (e.g. hospital, fire station), do not rely solely on the navigation system. • Some emergency services may not be included in the navigation map. Check relevant information in advance to stay prepared for an emergency. Stop the vehicle before using the update feature. • If you perform an update while driving, the screen may not display the current location normally. When the vehicle is driven after an update is complete, the current location is displayed normally. System handling Do not arbitrarily disassemble or modify the system. • It may cause an accident, fire or electric shock. Exercise caution and ensure that no liquid or foreign materials enter the system. • It may cause smoke generation, fire ignition or system failure. If the screen is not displayed, the volume is muted or other system failures occur, immediately stop using the system. • Otherwise, a fire, electric shock or system failure may result. If a problem is found, contact the customer service centre or service agency of the company. Safety Precautions Be sure to keep the following instructions. Otherwise, risk of minor injury or system damage may result. Operation Use the system with the vehicle started. • If you use the system for a long time with the vehicle stopped, it may cause battery discharge. Do not arbitrarily install an unauthorised aftermarket product in your vehicle. • It may cause system errors. • System errors caused by installing unapproved products are not covered under the warranty. System handling Do not apply excessive force or pressure to the system. • When you apply excessive force or pressure to the screen, the LCD panel or touch panel may get damaged. To clean the screen or button panel, first turn off the vehicle and then use a dry, soft cloth to wipe it. • Do not wipe using a rough or hard cloth, chemical fibre, organic solvent (e.g. alcohol, benzene, thinner) or air freshener. The panel surface may become scratched or damaged due to a chemical reaction. If you attach an air freshener to the air conditioner vent, the surface may deform due to leakage. If a problem is found, contact the customer service centre or service agency of the company."},
