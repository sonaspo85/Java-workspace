Problem Solution The air conditioner stops working. • Make sure the unit is receiving power. • Check the circuit breaker. If it is flipped off, flip it on again and restart the unit. If the problem persists, contact your service provider. • The Timed off function may have turned off the unit. Turn on the unit again. Cannot change the temperature. • Check if the unit is in Fan or MAX mode. If so, you cannot change the set temperature; the unit automatically controls the set temperature. Improper airflow temperature. • Check the set temperature. In Cool mode, cooling occurs only when the set temperature is lower than the current temperature. In Heat mode, heating occurs only when the set temperature is higher than the current temperature. • Use the [Temp] button on the remote control to change the set temperature. • Check if the air filter is blocked with dirt or debris. If the air filter is blocked, the cooling and heating performance may decrease. Clean the air filter regularly (page Cleaning the filter ). • Check if the outdoor unit is covered or is installed near obstacles. Remove the coverings and obstacles. • Check if the Defrost function is on (page Automatic defrost ). During defrost, the fan stops and warm air does not come out. • Check if doors or windows are open. This may cause poor circulation or performance. Close all doors and windows. • Check if the pipe length between the units exceeds the maximum pipe length (see “Typical installation” in the Installation manual). If so, the cooling and heating performance may decrease. Cannot change the airflow direction. • Check if the Good Sleep function is on in Cool mode. If so, you cannot control the airflow direction. Cannot change the fan speed. • Check if the unit is in AI Auto , Dry , or MAX mode or the Good Sleep function is on in Cool mode. In these conditions, you cannot control the fan speed; the unit automatically controls the fan speed. The remote control does not work. • Charge the remote control, using the USB port (type C) on the bottom of the remote control. • Make sure the remote control can send an unobstructed signal to the unit. • Keep bright lights away from the unit. Light from fluorescent bulbs or neon signs may interrupt the signal from the remote control. The Timed on/off function does not work. • Make sure to press the button on the remote control when setting the timer. The indicator on the indoor unit display blinks continuously. • Press the (Power) button to turn off the unit, or disconnect the power plug. • If the indicator light on the indoor unit display continues blinking, contact your service provider. Odors are coming from the unit during regular operation. • If the unit is operating in a smoky area, ventilate the room or operate the unit in Fan mode for 3 to 4 hours. There are no components in the unit that produce a strong odor. • Check if the drain lines are clean. Clean them regularly. The indoor unit display shows an error message. • If the indoor unit indicator blinks, write down the error code. Contact your service provider and provide them with the error code. The unit is generating noise. • It is normal for the unit to generate some noise while operating. If the pipe length between the units is less than 3 m and no coil was used (see “Typical installation” in the Installation manual), additional noise may be transmitted from the outdoor unit to the indoor unit via the piping. Smoke is coming from the outdoor unit. • In winter, most likely this is steam coming from the outdoor heat exchanger while the Defrost function is on. Water drips from the pipe connections on the outdoor unit. • Condensation may develop when the ambient temperature or humidity changes significantly. This is normal. Condensation forms on the surface of the indoor unit. • If the humidity is higher in the room in Cool mode, or the difference between the desired temperature and indoor temperature is great, condensation may form on the surface of the indoor unit.",
